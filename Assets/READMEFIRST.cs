    //To Riley, Stephen or Brodi

    //I have manage to add in a In-app Purchase script though it has one issue happening and I can find the solution
    //See if Karl knows how to deal with this

    //Next, we still need to sort out the whole time bonus for out of game.
    //I look at Riley script on keeping the money of what you had when you close it and reopen it.
    //I think we need to use the Void Awake and use something that might be along the Time.something

    //Next Title has been sorted of so we don't need to worry about that.
    //Though we do need to worry about the buttons that are in this game cause
    //I haven't got the time to make them look good so we got some area where
    //it just a white button so please can someone fix that and make them look good

    //Next if someone can add some sort of music to this game since I have't had experience with it.
    //If your trying to think of what music to add, just go for anything catchy so we can get Karl to
    //hum it out later.

    //Lastly, we got Washington DC to add into our game. I can write up the scripts and input a few things to
    //out but I would like if one of you guys are able to add it in and make a scrolling machanic if you are able 
    //to do so.

    //If somethings couldn't be done then I understand that and that ok. We just need to put it down somewhere
    //that says we weren't able to complete cetain task.

    //Sorry for not asking your help for this Stephen on Monday, I didn't realise how much we had
    //to do and I had had a lot of things going through my mind at the time.

    //Good job to everyone on this project. We all did the best we could and happy for what we did.
